# simple_puzzle_game
This project is about building a simple puzzle game in JavaScript.

The game is easy to build and looks like this:
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8  
```
It consists of nine boxes, numbered from 1 to 8, with one empty box. The empty box is used to rearrange the numbers, essentially solving the puzzle by sorting them.

Each number must be unique, and a random function is used to shuffle the numbers.

# How to use
## 1 - Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/paulovictorarmando/simple_puzzle_game.git
cd simple_puzzle_game
```
## 2 - Open the index.html file in your browser to start the game.
## 3 - Click on the numbered boxes to move them into the empty space and solve the puzzle.

# Note:
Donâ€™t focus too much on the design, haha! ðŸ˜„
